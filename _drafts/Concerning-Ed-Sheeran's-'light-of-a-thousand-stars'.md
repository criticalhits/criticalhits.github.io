title: Concerning Ed Sheeran's 'light of a thousand stars'
---

Does he only care about a few specific stars and shun the rest of them?

Is it an intentional vast understatement?

Do the stars symbolize something else, perhaps, like the thousand little revolving reflections of a disco ball?

Was it jusr a string of words that simply sounded great in his head?
