title: Everyone is a Leader
---

I don't know how true this statement is. But I have heard multiple public speakers say this little aphorism. The truth of this saying definitely depends on how you define a leader.

I think one of the key points to this statement is regarding how we can 'lead others', mainly: leading is not just acting in the role of a CEO of a company or a president of a club,  it is in everyday actions, big and small.

You are leading by example in an infinite number of situations. When you are the first person to thank the waitress in a restaurant and the rest of your group quickly pipe up with "Thanks!", "Oh yeah, thank you!", etc.
